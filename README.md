# CovidVisualization_Tableau


This project is to collect some usful data about covid-19 for the visualization by Tableau, the data collecting part includes:
1. Give a genal information of covid-19 by sum up the total cases and total deaths
2. Give a more detailed overall information about covid-19 about the deaths
3. Find the location has the max cases or the highest infection rate
4. Add date information for further analysis

We saved these four parts of data into 4 excel files, and imported them into Tableau. Then we analysised these data in Tabluea, and visualized them into one dashboard.
